## **Context:**
COVID-19 is an acute respiratory infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. It is potentially severe, highly transmissible, and has a global distribution. Source: Brazilian Government ([link](https://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/coronavirus/o-que-e-o-coronavirus)).

## **Objectives:**
The creation of this dashboard aims to assist public authorities in making decisions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Any decision to combat the pandemic should be data-driven. It is crucial to closely monitor the historical progression of the number of infections and/or deaths, as well as the progress of vaccination campaigns.

The availability of data on the pandemic's evolution over time in a specific geographic region is essential for effective management. This project seeks to build a data dashboard for exploring and interactively visualizing data related to the advancement of cases and vaccination efforts in Brazil. The data processing can be found in the notebook, and the dashboard is available at this [link](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/6faa99af-b8ce-4d03-aa84-d4cb6029f21f).
